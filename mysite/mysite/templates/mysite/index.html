        <h2>About Maverick</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Maverick Moore is a full stack developer based in Atlanta Georiga. He
          enjoys building software using modern web technologies including Django
          (Python) and React (JavaScript). He isnâ€™t very picky though; he likes
          the challenge of learning something new and keeping up with web development
          trends.</p>

        <p>From the beginning, Maverick has had a strong work ethic and a natural
          curiosity for all aspects of business but especially for marketing and
          digital presence. He built an online community for photographers and created
          a photo contest platform to boost engagement. It was a lot of work, but
          Maverick thinks work is fun; he is probably hunched over his laptop in
          some coffee shop, nose deep in documentation, doing his job or dreaming
          up another million dollar idea.</p>

        <p>He is especially interested in IoT, HR Tech, SMS applications,
          and marketing automation.</p>
